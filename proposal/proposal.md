## 1. Introduction

In this project we will explore how factors such as: Location, House
type, Area and Number of bathrooms influence the price of properties in
London. We will then use this information to identify the most
affordable places to stay given a set of conditions.

[Here is the dataset we plan on
using.](https://www.kaggle.com/arnavkulkarni/housing-prices-in-london)

This dataset contains 11 variables. Although a couple of these variables
are redundant (like the ‘\#’ variable, the ‘Property Name’ variable and
the ‘Postal Code’ variable).

The variables in this dataset are: ‘\#’, ‘Property Name’, ‘Price’,
‘House Type’, ‘Area in sq ft’, ‘No. of Bedrooms’, ‘No. of Bathrooms’,
‘No. of Receptions’, ‘Location’, ‘City/County’, ‘Postal Code’. All of
these are self explanatory except ‘\#’ which is an id for each listing.

Each row in this dataset is a listing for a property.

From the Metadata on the dataset’s kaggle page the data was obtained
through Web Scraping.
