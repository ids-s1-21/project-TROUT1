## 1. Introduction

In this project we will explore how factors such as: location, house
type, area and number of bathrooms influence the price of properties in
London. We will then use this information to identify the most
affordable places to stay given a set of conditions.

[Here is the dataset we’re
using.](https://www.kaggle.com/arnavkulkarni/housing-prices-in-london)

This dataset contains 11 variables. Although a couple of these variables
are redundant (like the ‘\#’ variable, the ‘Property Name’ variable and
the ‘Postal Code’ variable). If this dataset is unusable we have
included an alternative project proposal below.
