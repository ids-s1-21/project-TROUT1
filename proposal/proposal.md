## 1. Introduction

In this project we will explore how factors such as: Location, House
type, Area and Number of bathrooms influence the price of properties in
London. We will then use this information to investigate how the price
of housing in London varies with the number of bathrooms.

[Here is the dataset we plan on
using.](https://www.kaggle.com/arnavkulkarni/housing-prices-in-london)

This dataset contains 11 variables. Although a couple of these variables
are redundant (like the ‘\#’ variable, the ‘Property Name’ variable and
the ‘Postal Code’ variable).

The variables in this dataset are: ‘\#’, ‘Property Name’, ‘Price’,
‘House Type’, ‘Area in sq ft’, ‘No. of Bedrooms’, ‘No. of Bathrooms’,
‘No. of Receptions’, ‘Location’, ‘City/County’, ‘Postal Code’. All of
these are self explanatory except ‘\#’ which is an id for each listing.

Each row in this dataset is a listing for a property.

From the Metadata on the dataset’s kaggle page the data was obtained
through Web Scraping.

## 3. Data analysis plan

The final goal of our project is to answer: “Does the number of
bathrooms affect the price of a property in London?”

Response factor: The price of the property
(London*P**r**i**c**e*)*E**x**p**l**a**n**a**t**o**r**y**f**a**c**t**o**r* : *T**h**e**n**u**m**b**e**r**o**f**b**a**t**h**r**o**o**m**i**n**e**a**c**h**f**a**c**t**o**r*(*L**o**n**d**o**n*No. of
Bathrooms)

Here is a glimpse of the relation between those two factors

``` r
pound_in_M <- label_dollar(
  prefix = "£",
  suffix = "M",
  big.mark = ",",
  decimal.mark = "."
)
London%>%
  filter(`House Type` %in% c("House","Penthouse","Flat / Apartment","New development"))%>%
  mutate( 
    price_in_M = Price/1000000
  )%>%  #We reduce the number of price into M(e.g.:£1000000->£1M)
  ggplot(aes(x = `No. of Bathrooms`, y = price_in_M))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = pound_in_M)+
  labs(
    title = "Price vs No. of Bathroom plot, with regression line",
    subtitle = "For properties in London",
    x = "Number of bathrooms",
    y = "Price of property"
  )+
  facet_wrap(~ `House Type`)
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'

The answer seems to be “Yes”, since the regression line shows a slope.
But there are still a lot of problems with this plot: 1. The slope
doesn’t seem to fit the data well 2. There are too many confounding
variables, this plot could be showing area per sq foot increases the
price, and number of bathrooms is correlated with a greater area per sq
foot. To understand the influence the number of bathrooms has on price
we will have to investigate further.

We will solve these problems in the actual project.

If we really want to get the answer that “the number of bathrooms do
affect the price of the property”, we need to do those: 1. Remove the
confounding variables (This will be the majority of the work we are
going to do) 2. Show that there is a strong relationship between the
number of bathrooms and the price of the property
