# ZHIXIN's choice of dataset

London.csv

With this data set, we can make a plot of price per sq.ft against each region(house and flat), and show them on the map of London.(Details of maps is on https://r-spatial.org/r/2018/10/25/ggplot2-sf.html) I am also interested in that does the number of bathroom affect the price per sq.ft in each region.(My mom told me that kitchen and bathrooms are the most expensive in a house and I wanna see if it is really the case).
Also there are some houses that are not exactly in London city but in country around them, so we can filter them or process them seperatly.
Those include a large variety of applications of what we learned and didn't learn and may be a good dataset to process
