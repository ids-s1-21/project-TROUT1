posremo <- function(postcode) {

      temp = temp+1

#---------------------- From now this is my code

#I want to remove columns 6,7,8
Fixed_London = select(London, -c(6,7,8))

#I can't seem to get the file to write. I'll try again later
write_csv(Fixed_London, path = "./data/Fixed-London.csv")

```

```{r message=FALSE}
London %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = `House Type`)) +
  geom_bar()
```
We can see there are considerably more records of Flats, Houses, New Developments and Penthouses. We don't have enough information on Duplex, Mews or Studios to draw any meaningful conclusions so these records should probably be removed. 

```{r message=FALSE}
London %>%
  group_by(`House Type`) %>%
  summarise(
    `Area in sq ft` = mean(`Area in sq ft`),
    Price = mean(Price)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(Price))
```
Looking at this information we can see that area per sq ft doesn't seem to affect our data very prominently.
